# Minecraft Custom Items Demo Project

This sample demonstrates a set of different custom items with different capabilities.

## Prerequisites

**Install Node.js tools, if you haven't already**

We're going to use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) to get more tools to make the process of building our project easier.

Visit [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org).

Download the version with "LTS" next to the number and install it. (LTS stands for Long Term Support, if you're curious.) In the Node.js Windows installer, accept the installation defaults. You do not need to install any additional tools for Native compilation.

**Install Visual Studio Code, if you haven't already**

Visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com) and install Visual Studio Code.

# Minecraft Tutorial Sample Skinpack

This sample demonstrates a simple build process and TypeScript compilation for Minecraft. This readme shows how you can use Betas APIs experiment to build out simple gameplay styles. You can use this project as a starter for your own scripting projects.

## What Do I Do with This?

To make using this as easy as possible, I saved this as an .mcpack file.

To use it, download it and then double-click it. It will launch Minecraft and copy itself into the **skin_packs** folder in your **com.mojang** folder.

If you want to make changes to it, rename the file from **skins.mcpack** to **skins.zip** and then extract the contents like you would any other .zip file. Be sure to change the UUIDs in **manifest.json** before you try to import it again!

If you have any trouble with the **skins.mcpack** file, then download the .zip file and rename it to **skins.mcpack**.
